J'ai donc décidé de voir de quoi il s'agissait. J'ai vérifié quelques-unes de leurs publicités et voici ce que j'ai conclu:<br><br></div><ol><li>L'informatique est bien plus que du codage. La façon dont WhiteHat Jr. a abordé le sujet de l'informatique est la manière indienne typique de faire en sorte que les enfants mémorisent des blocs de code et des syntaxes, mais le codage est plus que la simple programmation d'une application prédéfinie dans un cours de 45 minutes. Cela a beaucoup à voir avec la résolution de problèmes du monde réel.</li></ol><div><br></div><div>Ils affirment qu'ils enseignent SpaceTech et AI, Machine Learning aux enfants. Honnêtement, je ne pense pas qu'un enfant aurait l'aptitude en mathématiques à apprendre ce genre de choses:<br><br><br>Et si vous pensez que ce n'est qu'une image aléatoire d'Internet que j'ai collée ici pour vous effrayer, vous vous trompez.<br>WhiteHat Jr. affirme hardiment dans son programme qu'ils enseigneraient la <strong><em>régression </em></strong>, les statistiques avancées avec l'apprentissage automatique à un enfant de 10e année. Sérieusement?? Même les mathématiques de niveau universitaire ne suffiraient pas à apprendre de tels concepts, à mon avis.<br>Et les affirmations selon lesquelles des enfants de 13 ans et des enfants de 9 ans obtiennent un emploi chez Google sont fausses. Comment un enfant de 9 ans peut-il trouver un emploi dans une entreprise FANG s'il y a beaucoup de candidatures pour adultes rejetées? Google est hyper sélectif quant aux personnes qu'il embauche et recherche les meilleurs talents. Une simple certification WhiteHat Jr. ne peut tout simplement pas vous rapporter un travail de plusieurs millions de dollars, c'est la réalité.<br>Les ingénieurs indiens de la plus haute qualité sont issus de l'IIT, n'est-ce pas? Maintenant, la façon dont les médias font la promotion des packages 1.5 cr est fausse, car seuls 5 à 10 ingénieurs de tous les IIT obtiennent des emplois aussi bien rémunérés à l' <strong>étranger </strong>. Alors comment un enfant de 9 ans qui n'a même pas terminé ses études primaires peut apprendre l'IA et obtenir des salaires aussi élevés. Ce n'est rien d'autre qu'une simple tactique de marketing.<br><figure data-trix-attachment=\"{&quot;contentType&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;filename&quot;:&quot;Capture d’écran de 2020-10-14 09-21-18.png&quot;,&quot;filesize&quot;:262619,&quot;height&quot;:768,&quot;sgid&quot;:&quot;BAh7CEkiCGdpZAY6BkVUSSIzZ2lkOi8vbG5jbGFzcy9BY3RpdmVTdG9yYWdlOjpCbG9iLzM_ZXhwaXJlc19pbgY7AFRJIgxwdXJwb3NlBjsAVEkiD2F0dGFjaGFibGUGOwBUSSIPZXhwaXJlc19hdAY7AFQw--414f6fd8b3d3e1b99caa0cf3ebf62594116e6f0d&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://localhost:3000/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBDQT09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--e568dd8d0ec4ea35e092989cd67b969b411d4007/Capture%20d%E2%80%99%C3%A9cran%20de%202020-10-14%2009-21-18.png&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:1366}\" data-trix-content-type=\"image/png\" data-trix-attributes=\"{&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;capture du prof kamate&quot;,&quot;presentation&quot;:&quot;gallery&quot;}\" class=\"attachment attachment--preview attachment--png\"><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBDQT09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--e568dd8d0ec4ea35e092989cd67b969b411d4007/Capture%20d%E2%80%99%C3%A9cran%20de%202020-10-14%2009-21-18.png\" width=\"1366\" height=\"768\"><figcaption class=\"attachment__caption attachment__caption--edited\">capture du prof kamate</figcaption></figure></div><ol><li>Ils jouent avec votre esprit en donnant l'impression que le codage est une chose très avancée.

J'ai donc décidé de voir de quoi il s'agissait. J'ai vérifié quelques-unes de leurs publicités et voici ce que j'ai conclu:<br><br></div><ol><li>L'informatique est bien plus que du codage. La façon dont WhiteHat Jr. a abordé le sujet de l'informatique est la manière indienne typique de faire en sorte que les enfants mémorisent des blocs de code et des syntaxes, mais le codage est plus que la simple programmation d'une application prédéfinie dans un cours de 45 minutes. Cela a beaucoup à voir avec la résolution de problèmes du monde réel.</li></ol><div><br></div><div>Ils affirment qu'ils enseignent SpaceTech et AI, Machine Learning aux enfants. Honnêtement, je ne pense pas qu'un enfant aurait l'aptitude en mathématiques à apprendre ce genre de choses:<br><br><br>Et si vous pensez que ce n'est qu'une image aléatoire d'Internet que j'ai collée ici pour vous effrayer, vous vous trompez.<br>WhiteHat Jr. affirme hardiment dans son programme qu'ils enseigneraient la <strong><em>régression </em></strong>, les statistiques avancées avec l'apprentissage automatique à un enfant de 10e année. Sérieusement?? Même les mathématiques de niveau universitaire ne suffiraient pas à apprendre de tels concepts, à mon avis.<br>Et les affirmations selon lesquelles des enfants de 13 ans et des enfants de 9 ans obtiennent un emploi chez Google sont fausses. Comment un enfant de 9 ans peut-il trouver un emploi dans une entreprise FANG s'il y a beaucoup de candidatures pour adultes rejetées? Google est hyper sélectif quant aux personnes qu'il embauche et recherche les meilleurs talents. Une simple certification WhiteHat Jr. ne peut tout simplement pas vous rapporter un travail de plusieurs millions de dollars, c'est la réalité.<br>Les ingénieurs indiens de la plus haute qualité sont issus de l'IIT, n'est-ce pas? Maintenant, la façon dont les médias font la promotion des packages 1.5 cr est fausse, car seuls 5 à 10 ingénieurs de tous les IIT obtiennent des emplois aussi bien rémunérés à l' <strong>étranger </strong>. Alors comment un enfant de 9 ans qui n'a même pas terminé ses études primaires peut apprendre l'IA et obtenir des salaires aussi élevés. Ce n'est rien d'autre qu'une simple tactique de marketing.<br><action-text-attachment sgid=\"BAh7CEkiCGdpZAY6BkVUSSIzZ2lkOi8vbG5jbGFzcy9BY3RpdmVTdG9yYWdlOjpCbG9iLzM_ZXhwaXJlc19pbgY7AFRJIgxwdXJwb3NlBjsAVEkiD2F0dGFjaGFibGUGOwBUSSIPZXhwaXJlc19hdAY7AFQw--414f6fd8b3d3e1b99caa0cf3ebf62594116e6f0d\" content-type=\"image/png\" url=\"http://localhost:3000/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBDQT09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--e568dd8d0ec4ea35e092989cd67b969b411d4007/Capture%20d%E2%80%99%C3%A9cran%20de%202020-10-14%2009-21-18.png\" filename=\"Capture d’écran de 2020-10-14 09-21-18.png\" filesize=\"262619\" width=\"1366\" height=\"768\" presentation=\"gallery\" caption=\"capture du prof kamate\"></action-text-attachment></div><ol><li>Ils jouent avec votre esprit en donnant l'impression que le codage est une chose très avancée.
